# Weekly Report

Student ID: 115010202 (Group number: 102; Role: Student C)

All the codes and commits can be viewed on the [**Github Link**](https://github.com/tavimori/CSC1002_GP102)

Declaration: Belows are only copies of commit records from Github, the raw version is on the github.

## Week1

**Decide to use Github to share the code**.

### Apr.13

Initial commit

- Name the project as **AlphaMazer** (笑)
- Have a plan.
  - Use algorithm to find the best path.
  - Use algorithm to evaluate the maze.
  - Use algorithm to find the best maze.

Teacher's sourcecode.

- Add teacher's predefined source code.
- Make the code executable.

Add backup. Add pass

- Add 'pass' to the mouse click

Add todo. Make the py files valid by adding.

Add readme file

Add readme file

Add readme file

### Apr.14

Add elementary planning.

- Use recursion to find the closest path.

MRP calc done

- The algorithm to calc MRP is done and available for test.

## Week 2

### Apr.28

CALC SCORE with two 102/62 SCORES

- **Help design the 62-mazes**. (62 is the MRP-Brick inside)

Add First Version of Path Planning. In development.

- Begin to program explorer.py
- All the click event will call the same function after log the button clicked.
- Merge the code from evaluator.

Add basic graphic for test. Add alpha maze into explorer. Add keyboard binding. Add some new mazes.

- Quickly prototype a mazer.py which can display the realtime maze, to test the explorer.py (The GUI is only  label based. Use '▉'to represent brick.)

Change test maze.

- Test different kind of mazes.

## Week3

### May.2

Change test maze.

First Mix. Fix an indent error, which might effect the evaluation of the path. Fix error of losing some steps.

- Sync update with other group mates.
- Has the first version of mazer.
- Fix a bug caused by an indent error. The bug makes the program find an not-so-well path under certain condition.

Beta2 Version update. New mazes.

Beta2 Version update. New mazes.

- The new maze, which is more symmetric, can be a little deceptive for the opposite team.

### May.4

Document tree optimization. Add some todo.

### May.5

Rename maze file. Add Variable protection. Add maze log function. Add (Dirty) Error print system in explorer (Escape)

- Use Try… Except… decorator to capture indexError. if such Error is raised, print a no path message. (I know it is dirty, but is good enough.)

Redesign the alpha explorer. Now alpha explorer can handle 99% conditions. Why not 100%? (Because I am lazy)

- Now the alpha explorer can change its path when it is at the critical point(where the opposite is thought to put a brick.)

New directory tree.

Update readme file.

Update Error Report by using wrapper.

No updates, only try to find better maze.

No updates, only try to find better maze.

### May.6

Final test.

### May.8

Capture name error. (So dirty...  but I don't care.)

## Finally

**The github repository is now open for public.** (Start from May.8)
